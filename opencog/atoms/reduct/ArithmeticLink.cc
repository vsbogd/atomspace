/// delta_reduce() -- delta-reduce the expression by summing constants, etc.
///
/// Recall the defintion of delta-reduction: it is the replacement of
/// functions with values by the value that the function would have.
/// For example, the delta-reduction of 2+2 is 4.
///
/// No actual black-box evaluation or execution is performed. Only
/// clearbox reductions are performed.
///
/// Examples: the delta-reduction of (FoldLink (Number 2) (Number 2))
/// is (Number 4) -- its just a constant.
///
/// The delta-reduct of (FoldLink (VariableNode "$x") (NumberNode 0))
/// is (VariableNode "$x"), because adding zero to anything yeilds the
/// thing itself.
///
/// This is certainly not an efficient, effective way to build a
/// computer algebra system.  It works, its just barely good enough
/// for single-variable arithmetic, but that's all.  For general
/// reduction tasks, there are two choices:
///
/// A) Convert atoms to some other CAS format, reduce that, and then
///    convert back to atoms.
///
/// B) Implement reduction with the Rule Engine, together with a set
///    of reduction rules for arithmetic.
///
/// In some sense B) is better, but is likely to have poorer performance
/// than A).  It also threatens to spiral out of control: We can add
/// ever-more rules to the rule engine to reduce ever-more interesting
/// algebraic expressions.
