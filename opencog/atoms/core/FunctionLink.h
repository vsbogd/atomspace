/**
 * The FunctionLink provides an important method: execute().
 * The execute() method performs delta-reduction on this atom, and
 * returns a Handle resulting from the execution.
 *
 * Here, "delta-reduction" is the name for the idea that certain Links
 * can be replaced by other Atoms that are operationally equivalent
 * but simpler.  For example, the delta-reduction of (Plus 2 2) is 4.
 * Delta-reduction can be understood in several ways. From the viewpoint
 * of term-rewriting, or inference or theorem-proving, a delta-reduction
 * is a (usually infinite) set of inference rules for reducing the
 * intial expression to the final expression. From the viewpoint of
 * proceedural computation, it just means "perform this computation
 * on this input", viz. "execute this function".
 *
 * The FunctionLink is meant to be a base class for any link type
 * that behaves like a function; i.e. can be executed.  Observe that
 * it derives from the FreeLink, and NOT the LambdaLink.  This may seem
 * counter-intuitive, and deserves an explanation, so here it is:
 * All link types inheriting from this class will always, by definition,
 * have their outgoing set be the arguments to that function. Think of
 * PlusLink, for example.  We don't want to insert a lambda with
 * variable declarations in there; that would just be weird and create
 * confusion.  If the arguments to PlusLink happen to include a
 * variable, that variable is necessarily free; thus, this class
 * dervies from FreeLink.
 *
 * Note that this class must NOT be used for user-defined functions;
 * users should use the LambdaLink for that.
